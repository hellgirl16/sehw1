This project has basic arithmetic functions - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division that can be performed between two numbers. 

## Installation

There is no installation steps as of now. To use the project, copy the files in the `code/` directory to your source directory.

## Usage

Usage of the four functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) are as follows:

```python
import arithmatic

a = 12
b = 3

sum_of_a_and_b = arithmatic.sum(a, b) # Sum of a and b
sub_of_b_from_a = arithmatic.sub(a, b) # Subtraction of b from a
mul_of_a_with_b = arithmatic.mul(a, b) # Multiplication of a with b
div_of_a_by_b = arithmatic.div(a, b) # Division of a by b

```
